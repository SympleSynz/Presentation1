###Introduction
Scratch is a free educational programming language that was developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab[1] and is meant to help "young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively"[2].

Scratch falls under the category of "Block languages" with its use of dragging and dropping of blocks and attaching them to each other, like a jigsaw puzzle, in order to create scripts.  Block languages are also considered visual programming languages, requiring visual acuity in order to use the language for all its effects.

It is designed to be accessed as a desktop and online resource that can be for educational and personal entertainment usage. The goal is to provide stepping stones for more advanced programming languages[3].

###Background
- Purpose of development?
Scratch was originally designed for after school programs in economically underprivileged areas. It was established in the Computer Clubhouse program, which is a place for young people to be creative and explore their ideas within new technologies. After observing this program and the interactions bweteen the program and  the users, the researchers were able to advance the designs of the program. Now Scratch is used in the educational system to help students of all age groups, disciplines, and is in several different countries formatted in their languages.  

- Class of programming?
Scratch is a visual programming tool that allows the users to visualize difficult concepts by developing their ideas graphically rather than like most programming languages that use text specifically. Developing the skills to program these difficult concepts helps prepare them for other basic programming languages. As programmers, code is organized into sections or blocks of code.Scratch is also considered a block-structured programming language, because it takes these concepts and uses the ability to drag and drop the blocks or sections of ideas to a staging window.   


###Scratch Details
- User Interface 
Starting in the upper left of the screen is a large window, known as the staging area, which is where the results of a running program will be displayed. Inside the staging area contains a sprite; its a golden carton cat object that will perform the actions or commands. There is one initially set up from a preset library, but they can also be created by the user in the paint editor. If multiple sprites and costumes are created, only one can be used at a time and will be listed in the sprite window below the staging area. To the right of these windows is the section containing the tabs for the scripts, the costumes, and the sounds. Under the scripts tab has a list of several categories of commands, such as Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Data, Events, Control, Sensing, Operators, and More Blocks. When selecting a specific category, the user will see the scripts are the multicolored and multishaped blocks that contain coding expressions on them. These blocks will be used by dragging and dropping them into the script area window and can be connected to each other. Next to the script tab is the Costume tab. This is the tab to be selected if the user wishes to change the sprite or create other background effects. Next to the Costume tab is the Sound tab, that allows the user to create various sounds or music for the sprite. The largest window on the right side of the screen is the visual project area for the user to create block programming code. When blocks are drug to this area, they will be connected in a particular order of operations that the programmer wants the object sprite to carry out. For a detailed picture view, see the following.

- Description of the language and how it is used
Since scratch is a block language, the blocks have to be moved around. This is how you build your project or program, which doesn't require a particular syntax. This allows for the visualization instead of having to type code, build, and look for typing mistakes. Because visually it has a game like interface and made simply, educators are able to tech people at younger ages and children are able to relate more easily. However, even though Scratch has the ability to make it simple enough for children to understand, it also has multiple background tools that allow for more extensive or complex programming. It also has the ability to be extended by being able to create your own blocks, add lists or variable, or being able to connect other related hardware programs. These hardware programs allow it to reach the outside world by robotics, sensing and sound, or many other possibilities. 


###Conclusions
In conclusion, scratch is believed to be an ideal tool to teach kids the beginning level of programming and beyond. This language is being implemented all over different parts of the world. The future of scratch seems to have a continued growth expansion plan. The developers met their original goal and from there it moved to the educational systems of all levels. Because its offered as a free service and there are many available resources to help instructors incorporate it into their curriculum, the prediction of this program is continued growth. If it progresses, it will affect future generations with more possiblities of exposure. Its important to expose them and allow for creativity as younger ages.
