###Introduction
Scratch is a free educational programming language that was developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab[1] and is meant to help "young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively"[2].

Scratch falls under the category of "Block languages" with its use of dragging and dropping of blocks and attaching them to each other, like a jigsaw puzzle, in order to create scripts.  Block languages are also considered visual programming languages, requiring visual acuity in order to use the language for all its effects.

It is designed to be accessed as a desktop and online resource that can be for educational and personal entertainment usage. The goal is to provide stepping stones for more advanced programming languages[3].

###Background
-Purpose of development?
Scratch was originally designed for after school programs in economically underprivileged areas. It was established in Computer Clubhouse program, which is a place for young people to be creative and explore their ideas within new technologies. After observing this program and the interactions with the users, the researchers were able to advance the designs of the program. Now Scratch is used in the educational system to help students of all age groups, disciplines, and is in several different countries formatted in their languages.  

-Class of programming?
Scratch is a visual programming tool that allows the users to visualize difficult concepts by developing their ideas graphically rather than like most programming languages that use text specifically. Developing the skills to program these difficult concepts helps prepare them for other basic programming languages. As programmers, code is organized into sections or blocks of code.Scratch is also considered a block-structured programming language, because it takes these concepts and uses the ability to drag and drop the blocks or sections of ideas to a staging window.   


###Scratch Breakdown
-User Interface 
Starting in the upper left of the screen is a large window, known as the staging area, which is where the results of a running program will be displayed. Inside the staging area contains a sprite; its a golden carton cat object that will perform the actions or commands. There is one initially set up from a preset library, but they can also be created by the user in the paint editor. If multiple sprites and costumes are created, only one can be used at a time and will be listed in the sprite window below the staging area. To the right of these windows is the section containing the tabs for the scripts, the costumes, and the sounds. Under the scripts tab has a list of several categories of commands, such as Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Data, Events, Control, Sensing, Operators, and More Blocks. When selecting a specific category, the user will see the scripts are the multicolored and multishaped blocks that contain coding expressions on them. These blocks will be used by dragging and dropping them into the script area window and can be connected to each other. Next to the script tab is the Costume tab. This is the tab to be selected if the user wishes to change the sprite or create other background effects. Next to the Costume tab is the Sound tab, that allows the user to create various sounds or music for the sprite. The largest window on the right side of the screen is the visual project area for the user to create block programming code. When blocks are drug to this area, they will be connected in a particular order of operations that the programmer wants the object sprite to carry out.
