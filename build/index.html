<br><div><img src="images/MinimizeHelp.PNG"></div><div class="row">By clicking the x in the red circle, the help/tutorial bar will be minimized.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/StageWindow.PNG"></div><div class="row">This area is the Stage area. This window is meant for previewing the scripts running.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/SpriteWindow.png"></div><div class="row">This area is the Sprite area. This window is for keeping track of the sprites and art assets that are applied to the sprites.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/BlockPaletteWindow.png"></div><div class="row">This area is the Block Palette area. This is where all of the script logic can be found, in block form.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/ScriptAreaWindow.png"></div><div class="row">This area is the Script area. This is where the blocks will be added in order to build scripts to run the Scratch program.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CostumeWindow.png"></div><div class="row">This tabbed area replaces the Block Pallet area and Script area with the Costume area.  Much like the Block Pallet area, the Costume area along the tab keeps track of the current images being used and the sprites. The work area to the right, is a lot like Paint in Windows, which allows for editing and creating art objects.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/SoundWindow.png"></div><div class="row">This tabbed area replaces the Block Pallet area or the Costume area with the Sound area.  The columned area under the tabs lists the current sounds added to the Scratch program. The work area to the right of that allows for recording and basic editing of the sound waves.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CursorTools.png"></div><div class="row">These are the cursor tools. They allow for minor manipulations of the Stage or Script area. The tools allow for shrinking and growing images or blocks as well as duplicating and deleting sprites and blocks.</div><br>
<br><h3>The Block Pieces</h3><p> The script blocks are designed to act like puzzle pieces. Each block has programming logic written on it, and the blocks fit into each other to create a single logical script. The following are the example of block shapes and what they represent. </p><div><img src="images/HatShape.png"></div><div class="row">This is the Hat Block. The Hat block is the starting block for a script. The rounded top indicates that no other block can go before it. The extruded portion at the bottom indicates that this block is to fit into another block.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CapBlock.png"></div><div class="row">This is the Cap Block. The Cap block is the last block to be added to script. The rounded bottom with no extruded piece indicates that this is the last block and not other block will fit after this block. The top of the block has a divet that allows for another block to go before.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CBlock.png"></div><div class="row">This is the C Block because it makes the shape of a C. This block is usually used for conditional loops such as 'if', 'if-else', and 'forever'</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/BooleanBlock.png"></div><div class="row">This is the Boolean Block. This block is the conditional for conditional statements. This block is inserted into other blocks that act as conditional. For example, if a block starts with 'if', this block is inserted after the 'if' as the conditional.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/ReportBlock.png"></div><div class="row">This is the Reporter Block. This block is used as values and can hold numbers and strings</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Error.png"></div><div class="row">This is an example of an error when building a script. If the logic is incorrect for the script, a red outline will appear around the script indicating an error.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Example.PNG"></div><div class="row">This is an example of a fully built script. Once the green flag icon is clicked, the script runs. The sprite will follow the mouse cursor for 9 seconds, then the sound clip, 'meow' will play. Afterwards, everything stops.</div><br>
<br><h3>Getting Started</h3><p> The following will walk through creating a simple side scrolling program. There are many approaches to starting a Scratch program, this is just one way.</p><div><img src="images/BlankWindow2.PNG"></div><div class="row">For this side scroller, we will use the starting cat sprite. By clicking on the costume tab, we can see that there are two images for the cat sprite.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/NextCostume.PNG"></div><div class="row">Those two 'costumes' are the images the cat sprite can switch between the two. By switching between the two costumes, the sprite will give the impression of movement. So, to start, we want to grab the block 'next costume' under the look category.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/WaitCostume.PNG"></div><div class="row">We do want a hesitation between the costume changes to make sure that the switching isn't going too fast. We will grab the 'wait 1 sec' block, under the control category, and place it on top of the 'next costume' block. We will then change the time to 0.25</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/ChangeWaitCostume.PNG"></div><div class="row">Because 1 sec is too long, we will change the value to 0.25</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/StartCat.PNG"></div><div class="row">To initiate the sprite movement, we need a way to start the script. Going to the event categoy, we will use the 'when space key pressed' and attach it to the top of the block stack.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/DropDownCostume.PNG"></div><div class="row">We will select the downward triangle next to the word space to get the drop down window. And we will select 'right arrow'.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CatCostumeScript.PNG"></div><div class="row">Now the cat sprite and script has been completed, we can work on the rest of the scene.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/NewSprite.png"></div><div class="row">Now we will create a new sprite by clicking the 'choose sprite from library' button in the sprite area.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Sprite.PNG"></div><div class="row">We are going to use a sprite image already in the library for some background scenery.  Select the cloud image to create a cloud sprite.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Placement.PNG"></div><div class="row">We are going to click and hold the image of the cloud in the Stage area, and drag it up to the upper left side for placement.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Start.PNG"></div><div class="row">This cloud is going to be rolling by in the side scroller, so we will need to add a script to the sprite. Every sprite can have its own script to act independently from other sprites. For this cloud, we want it to start the movement the same time the cat sprite moves. So we grab the same event block as the cat sprite.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Move.PNG"></div><div class="row">The cloud will be moving, so we will grab the 'change x by []' block from the Motion category and attach it to our starting block.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1ChangeMove.PNG"></div><div class="row">We will change the value of x to change by a -1 because we want the cloud to move to the left while the cat sprite looks like it is moving to the right.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1If.PNG"></div><div class="row">We then grab the 'if' block from the control category and add it to the stack.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Operator.PNG"></div><div class="row">When the cloud hits the edge of the window, we want something to happen. This is the purpose of the 'if' block. We need to add a conditional block to the 'if' block, so we grab the '[] &lt; []' block from the operators category</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1XPosition.PNG"></div><div class="row">Grabbing the 'x position' block from the motion category and adding it to the left side of the '[] &lt; []' block, will allow a comparison of the x position of the cloud sprite to whatever value is on the right.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Hide.PNG"></div><div class="row">Since the stage window is only -240 x 240 for a size on the x-axis, we will set the value to be -280, so that the cloud will go off the window. But the entire cloud is unable to disappear, so we will add a 'hide' block to make the sprite disappear once its x position is less that -280.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Wait.PNG"></div><div class="row">Ultimately, we will have a second cloud sprite that will be moving across the top of the window, that's why we want this cloud sprite to stay hidden for a short period of time as the other one travels across the screen. This will give the impression of the cat moving slowly. We grab the 'wait [] secs' block from the control category and change the time to 14.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Show.PNG"></div><div class="row">After waiting, we want the cloud sprite to appear again, so we grab the 'show' block from the looks category and add it to the stack, inside the 'if' block.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1SetX.PNG"></div><div class="row">The cloud sprite needs to be reset to the other side of the window, so we grab the 'set x to []' block from the motion category and add it as the last block in the 'if' block. Then we add the value 300 to the same block so that the cloud sprite starts off the window.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud1Script.PNG"></div><div class="row">Now this cloud sprite's script is complete</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CloudDuplicate.PNG"></div><div class="row">But we want another cloud sprite to be moving the exact same as the first. This is where we will use the duplicate tool at the top of the screen. We will hit that icon click the cloud sprite in the Sprite area.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Cloud2.PNG"></div><div class="row">When we select cloud2, we see that it has the exact same script as the first cloud. The duplicate tool copied everything over.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CloudsPlacement.PNG"></div><div class="row">We will move the clouds around to be placed where we want them to start once the scripts start to run.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/Backdrop.PNG"></div><div class="row">Next, we need a background. So we select the backdrop found in the Sprite area. Notice how the Costume tab has now changed to say 'Backdrop'.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/BackdropColor.PNG"></div><div class="row">We'll add a gradiant blue color to the backdrop by selecting the paint can (to fill), the gradiant option (to style), and the blue color from the palette.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/BackdropGroundSelect.PNG"></div><div class="row">We need a ground for the cat sprite to walk on, so we will use the rectangle tool, with the solid box option, and the redish brown color from the palette, and select a rectangled area toward the bottom of the backdrop.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/BackdropGroundSet.PNG"></div><div class="row">Once created, an option is available to move the rectangle around, rotate it, or even resize it. But we don't want to do any of that, so we will select off the backdrop.</div><br>
<br><div><img src="images/CatPlacement.PNG"></div><div class="row">Final step, we click and hold the cat sprite and move it to be over the ground. The scripts for all the sprites are done and the background is set. The Scratch program is complete and ready to be run. Move the cursor into the stage area and press the right arrow key to see the program run.</div><br>
